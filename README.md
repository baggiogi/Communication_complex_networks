# Communication over Complex Networks 

This repository contains the code used in the the paper:

> G. Baggio, V. Rutten, G. Hennequin, S. Zampieri "Efficient Communication over Complex Dynamical Networks: The Role of Matrix Non-Normality", Submitted for publication, 2020. 

In particular:

- The folder `rate` contains the Python scripts for computing and plotting the behavior of the transmission rate over time for random and regular network topologies

- The folder `rate_max_vs_noise` contains the Python scripts for computing and plotting the behavior of the maximum  transmission rate against readout noise level for random and regular network topologies

- The folder `rate_max_vs_diameter` contains the Python scripts for computing and plotting the behavior of the maximum transmission rate against network diameter for random and regular non-normal networks built via "directed stratification" procedure

- The folder `c_elegans` contains the Python scripts for computing and plotting the behavior of the transmission rate against network diameter over time for the chemical synapse network of the nematode C. elegans
